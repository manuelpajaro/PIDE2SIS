# Simulation of a Partial Integro-Differential Equation (PIDE) 
The PIDE model serves as an approximation of a compartmental stochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model.
## PIDEsis.m File to simulate a PIDE model with constant infection rate
Parameters:

 cumI0 -> initial number of infected persons

 beta -> infection rate 

## PIDEsis_v.m File to simulate a PIDE model with variable infection rate
Parameters:

 cumI0 -> initial number of infected persons

 beta1 -> infection rate 1

 beta2 -> infection rate 2

 Tchange -> day in which the infection rate changes

 ## ODE. Folder with the scripts to solve the deterministic ODE model
 ## SSAcme. Folder with the SSA scripts to solve the CME and data generated
